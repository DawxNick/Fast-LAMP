# Fast-LAMP
Quickly create a fully functional LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 16.04.

To use the script, run the following commands.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DawxNick/Fast-LAMP/master/Fast-LAMP.sh

chmod +x Fast-LAMP.sh

./Fast-LAMP.sh
```
Follow the prompts and your LAMP Stack will be created.

Feel free to use my other bash script Fast-A2vHost.sh to create your vHosts.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, compatible with Fast-A2vHost.
